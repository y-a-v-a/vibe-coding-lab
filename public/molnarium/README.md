# Molnarium - Interstices Variables

A web-based interpretation of Vera Molnár's "Interstices" works, exploring systematic randomness in grid compositions.

## Description

This interactive piece generates an 8x8 grid of purple squares with controllable random displacement, creating variations that echo Vera Molnár's pioneering computer art from the 1960s-70s. Each square is positioned with controlled randomness, creating organic variations within a systematic structure.

## Features

- Interactive randomness control via slider
- Automatic regeneration every 17 seconds with random parameters
- Responsive grid layout that scales with viewport
- Visual progress indicator
- Hamburger menu interface (click or press 'H')

## Controls

- **Randomness Slider**: Control the amount of positional variation (0-30)
- **H Key**: Toggle menu panel
- **Auto-cycle**: Pattern automatically regenerates with random parameters

## Inspiration

Vera Molnár (1924-2023) was a Hungarian-French artist and pioneer of computer art. Her "Interstices" series explored the systematic introduction of controlled randomness into geometric compositions, questioning the relationship between order and chaos in visual art.

## Technical Details

- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation
- 8x8 grid system (64 squares total)
- CSS Grid layout with responsive sizing
- Purple color scheme: `rgba(128, 0, 128, 0.5)`
- 17-second auto-regeneration cycle

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the interactive artwork. Use the hamburger menu to access controls and adjust the randomness parameter in real-time.
