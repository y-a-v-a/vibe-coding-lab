# Eight Red Rectangles

A generative art canvas inspired by the geometric abstraction of **Vera Molnár** and the suprematist compositions of **Kazimir Malevich**. Creates randomized arrangements of eight colored rectangles with interactive controls for exploring compositional variations.

## Artistic inspiration

This work draws from two pioneering artists:

### Vera Molnár (1924-2023)
- Pioneer of computer art and algorithmic composition
- Explored systematic variations in geometric forms
- Used controlled randomness to generate series of related works
- Known for her methodical approach to abstraction

### Kazimir Malevich (1879-1935)
- Founder of Suprematism movement
- Focused on pure geometric forms and color relationships
- Famous for compositions using squares, rectangles, and circles
- Emphasized the spiritual power of simple geometric elements

## Features

- **Eight rectangles per composition** - following the constraint-based approach
- **Randomized positioning** with collision detection options
- **Variable geometry** - from perfect squares to varied rectangles
- **Rotational freedom** - rectangles can be oriented at any angle
- **Color customization** - explore different chromatic relationships
- **Opacity control** - create layered, translucent effects
- **Interactive regeneration** - infinite compositional possibilities

## Controls

### Keyboard shortcuts
- **H** - Toggle controls panel visibility
- **R** - Regenerate composition

### Interactive parameters
- **Squareness** - Control variation from perfect squares to diverse rectangles
- **Fill Color** - Choose any color for the geometric elements
- **Opacity** - Adjust transparency for layering effects
- **Prevent Overlap** - Toggle collision detection for clean vs. layered compositions

## Artistic concept

Each generation creates a unique composition while maintaining the essential characteristics of geometric abstraction. The work explores:

- **Systematic variation** - algorithmic approaches to artistic creation
- **Color relationships** - how single colors interact with white space
- **Compositional balance** - random placement within structured constraints
- **Form and space** - the tension between geometric elements and empty canvas

## Technical implementation

- **Canvas-based rendering** with full viewport coverage
- **Collision detection** using Separating Axes Theorem for rotated rectangles
- **Responsive design** that adapts to any screen size
- **Real-time parameter adjustment** with immediate visual feedback
- **Clean, minimal interface** focusing attention on the composition

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser
2. Press **H** to reveal controls
3. Adjust parameters to explore different compositional styles
4. Press **R** or click "Redraw" to generate new arrangements
5. Experiment with overlapping vs. non-overlapping compositions

Perfect for exploring computational creativity, geometric abstraction, and the intersection of algorithmic processes with artistic expression.
