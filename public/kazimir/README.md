# Dynamic Malevich Red Square

An interactive interpretation of Kazimir Malevich's "Red Square" (1915) with organic animation.

## Overview

This project transforms Malevich's static red square into a living digital artwork. The square continuously deforms through smooth, organic movement generated by mathematical noise functions.

## Features

- **Organic Animation**: The square's upper-right corner moves fluidly using noise functions
- **Faithful Aesthetics**: Color and composition inspired by the 1915 original
- **Responsive Canvas**: Adapts to any screen size
- **Performance Optimized**: Smooth 60fps animation with error handling

## Technical Details

- **HTML5 Canvas** for rendering
- **Vanilla JavaScript** animation
- **Custom Noise Algorithm** combining sine/cosine waves for organic movement
- **Bounded Movement** keeps animation within canvas limits

The movement uses a simplified noise function:
```javascript
function simpleNoise(x, y) {
  return Math.sin(x * 0.01) * Math.cos(y * 0.01) * 
         Math.sin(x * 0.02 + y * 0.02) * Math.cos(x * 0.005 - y * 0.005);
}
```

## Artistic Vision

Explores the tension between:
- Static geometric perfection vs. dynamic flow
- Mathematical precision vs. natural movement  
- Classic suprematism vs. digital creativity

The subtle deformation creates a hypnotic, meditative effect while honoring Malevich's revolutionary vision.

## Usage

Open in any modern browser - animation starts automatically and runs indefinitely.
